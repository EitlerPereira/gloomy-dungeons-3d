non-free folder contains non-free graphics and levels.
You can **not** use non-free content in your products.

Non-free graphics: Denis Smoktunovich (smoktunovich@gmail.com)
Non-free levels: Zin (zin.wtf@gmail.com)

I put non-free content only for clean compiling, because there are some new graphics, which didn't have free equivalent.
