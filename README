What is it?
It is old-school 3d shooter, indie game developed by small team.
It didn't use hi-end engine, so it looks more like wolf-3d than quake or even doom.
As side effect, it works on low-end phones pretty fast.
It has big sexy square pixels (*love*)... You should really love pixelart (like me :)

I put non-free content only for clean compiling, because there are some new graphics, which didn't have free equivalent.
