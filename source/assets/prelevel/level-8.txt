That’s all! All tests are over. You proved that you are in excellent physical and mental shape, and is fully prepared to work hard for the benefit of the Empire.

But K. department are a bit offended with you and our department for “a little non-working” T-999, so they pushed you to another test.
But they don’t know how great out department is, so just break the T-999-MK2 quickly and without time wasting.

At the end of beating push the switch to return to base.
It’s priceless to watch frustrated officers of K. department, for everything else use bank cards of Imperial Bank.
