You impressed me! Especially surprising was that right hook.

At this test you have to check what effect the bullets have upon the new development of K. department . I’ll tell you a secret, our Uncle would be very pleased if their new shiny T-999 left the testing area in a completely non-operational state.

That’s pretty easy, take your trusty RJ-45 using switch weapon button, aim at this cybernetic bug and push the action button.
